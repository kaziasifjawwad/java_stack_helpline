# Spring Security: Implementing the UserDetailsService

The UserDetailsService is an interface that must be implemented in Spring Security for authentication purposes. It requires implementation of a single method:

`UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username)`

The `loadUserByUsername` method returns a `UserDetails` object, 
which is another interface that must be implemented. The main purpose of the UserDetails 
object is to retrieve the username, password, and roles of a specific user.

When the backend receives a request, it verifies the user 
credentials through the implemented UserDetailsService class. Spring Security attempts 
to find the credentials using the 
UserDetailsService and returns the wrapped credentials through the UserDetails interface.
