## Integration test
Integration testing is a software testing method in which individual units or components of
a software application are combined and tested as a group. The goal of integration testing
is to ensure that the various components of the application work together as expected and to 
identify any issues that may arise from the interaction between those components. 
This type of testing is typically performed after unit testing and before system testing.

There are different types of integration test. Some of them are described below : 


>**Component test:** This type of test focuses on testing the integration of individual components of the application,
such as a service and its repository. It's useful for identifying issues with the interaction between components 
and ensuring that they work together as expected.

>**Contract test**: This type of test focuses on testing the integration between different services 
or applications. The goal is to ensure that different services or applications can communicate with 
each other correctly and that the contracts between them are being followed.

>**Service test**: This type of test focuses on testing the integration of the application with external 
services, such as a database or a web service. It's useful for ensuring that the application can
communicate with the external service correctly and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur.

>**End-to-end test**: This type of test focuses on testing the integration of the entire application, 
including all its components and external dependencies. The goal is to ensure that the application 
works as expected from the user's perspective and that all the different 
parts of the application work together correctly.

>**Acceptance test**: This type of test focuses on testing the integration of
the entire application from the customer's or user's perspective, it's used to ensure that 
the system meets the requirements and acceptance criteria.

>**Big Bang Test:** This type of test focuses on testing the integration of all components
of the application at once. The goal of big bang testing is to test the entire system 
as a whole and to ensure that all components are integrated and working together correctly. 
Big bang testing is typically performed after all the individual components have been tested 
and integrated. It can be used to identify issues that may 
arise when all the components are working together in a real-world scenario.
